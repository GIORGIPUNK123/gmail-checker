How it works

```
git clone https://github.com/GIORGIPUNK123/gmail-checker
cd gmail-checker
npm i
node ./dist/index.js
```

provide combolist of gmail accounts
format email:password
example
`test@gmail.com:test123`
once program is finished check `out` directory for results
program can't handle captchas and is beta version for now
